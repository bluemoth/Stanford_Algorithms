Algorithm for computing strongly connected components. 
File format (directed graph):
-Vertices labeled 1-875714
-Edges are indicated by rows
-vertex lebel in first column i sthe tail, and the vertex in second column is the head
Example:
11th row => "2 47646", meaning vertex with label 2 has an outgoing edge to vertex label 47646

Instructions: Use SCC algorithm from lecture (will choose DFS slick method)

Output:
output the sizes of the 5 largest SCCs in the given graph, in decreasing order sizes, separated by commas. 
Keep in mind memory management due to file size...
