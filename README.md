# Stanford Algorithms Online Course

This repo contains my submitted homeworks for the Stanford Algorithms (online) course offered through coursera (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms). All homeworks were completed in Python to get a high level understanding of the content. 


A very helpful class to gain understanding around algorithms, data structures, and how to think about approaching computer science problems.

<ul>
<li>Big O notation
<li>Multiplication (Karatsuba)
<li>Karger Min-Cut Algorithm
<li>Merge Sort
<li>Quick Sort
<li>Graph theory
</ul>

[Module2](https://github.com/jcase34/Stanford-Algorithms-Course/tree/main/Module2) - Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures
<ul>
<li>Breadth-first search
<li>Depth-first search
<li>Strongly Connected Components
<li>Topological Ordering
<li>Dijkstra Algorithm
<li>Heap data structure
<li>Binary trees, red/black trees
<li>Median Maintenance (via heap operations)
<li>Hash tables, operations, and methods for creating unique hash functions
<li>Two Sum Problem
</ul>
